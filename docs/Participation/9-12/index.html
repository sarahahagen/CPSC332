        <li>Wikipedia, Washington State Licensing, Wordle - The New York Times</li>
        <li>I did find unexpected warnings and errors. With the Wikipedia page there were several errors, no errors with Washington State Licensing (personally, I was not expecting that), and many warnings with Wordle - The New York Times.</li>
        <li>Given the description in the about page, I feel the web developers should make changes. Some errors and changes they might make based on the validator output are the link references, correctly formatting lists (ol vs. ul, and li), headers, paragraphs, CSS formatting, and correctly defining tags. According to the validator output, there are no errors or warnings.</li>
